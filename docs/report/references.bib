	abstract="We explain how a discrete grey level image can be numer- ically translated into a completely pixel independent geometric struc- ture made of oriented curves with grey levels attached to them. For that purpose, we prove that the Affine Morphological Scale Space of an image can be geometrically computed using a level set decomposi- tion/reconstruction and a well adapted curve evolution scheme. Such an algorithm appears to be much more accurate than classical pixel-based ones, and allows continuous deformations of the original image.",
